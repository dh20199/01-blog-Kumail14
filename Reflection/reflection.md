# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)
Answer: It is important to have semantic elements because it makes it easier for people and machines to understand. Applications become more accessible which in turn allows people to make customizations (more functionality is provided) and it also provides equal access for people with disabilties. Further, different types of data can be distingueshed, therefore making it easier to see what information is displayed on the webpage. Also, by using semantic elements, the computer can understand the overall content which has been written. Lastly, there are 3 reasons why machines should be able to read the webpage which are SEO, Accessibility, and Maintenance.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.
