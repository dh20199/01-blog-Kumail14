        Adam Smith was a highly influential political economist and philosopher. He played a significant role in the history of social thought by introducing two concepts which were self-interest and the invisible hand (Edward W. Coker, 1990). He was widely known for some of the works he published which included The Wealth of Nations, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and History of Astronomy (Emma Rothschild, 1994). Each of his works served as different purposes. In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith talks about how the price system is used to allocate different resources in the free market system (Edward W. Coker, 1990). Further, in the Theory of Moral Sentiments, he talks about how social relationships lead to sympathy and sentiments (Edward W. Coker, 1990). Also, in the History of Astronomy, Adam Smith states that the system approach was created due to certain principles related to direct philosophical inquires (Edward W. Coker, 1990). This allowed him to present his idea that economics took up a small part of the system (Edward W. Coker, 1990). Lastly, Adam Smith uses his concept of the invisible hand differently in the works which he has published and this influenced the interpretation of modern economists (Emma Rothschild, 1994).
